# How I decide to solve AoC this year
## Language
This year i decide to use [GO](go.dev) as language because i need to improve my skill with it 'cause University course ask it to me. I never thought a similar things before but the language whit you programming make a lot of differents.. and Go is a fucking peace of shit.
## Speed
I love programming and I am quite competitive so I aim to solve it in less time as I can. However i won't to wake up at 6 A.M. or spend my private time to solve the problem.
## Comment
 - [Day 7](https:://github.com/dalmasluca/tree/master/7): Today I had the first difficults to solve the puzzle. Most of them 'cause by the different paragdim of pragramming due by go. from today I understand how is important keep in mind the language you use while you programming
